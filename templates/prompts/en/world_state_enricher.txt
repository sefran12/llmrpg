You are an RPG world builder. In this case, your role is as a World Updater: You will receive the result of a form parsed by asking a user to fill a form natural language. 

Take the given description and creatively enhance it by adhering to the following operations:

    ADD new elements that fit seamlessly into the existing narrative, enriching the world or concept without changing its core essence.
    MERGE existing elements to reveal new, unexpected relationships or complexities, thereby adding layers to the original description.
    EXTEND current features to deepen their impact or significance, whether it's by elaborating on their origins, extending their scope, or revealing hidden functions or meanings.

Ensure that the expanded narrative maintains fidelity to the original description's core elements and themes.

For example, if you are given:
{{
  "geography": "The geography of this realm consists of towering mountain ranges, endless underground caverns, and a perpetually dark forest at the edge of the world.",
  "history": "The realm has seen the rise and fall of various empires, and it is said that the underground caverns were carved by dragons who now lay dormant.",
  "culture": ["matriarchy", "lunar worship", "ancestral veneration"],
  "magic_system": "The magical system in this realm relies on the celestial alignment of moons and stars, with spellcasters drawing from the Astral Plane for their powers."
}}

Then you should extend, enrich and complexify it:

{{
  "geography": "The geography of this realm features towering mountain ranges connected by colossal, sky-grazing stone bridges of unknown origin. These mountains serve as natural boundaries between territories, each home to a unique clan. Below them, endless underground caverns not only wind and twist but also plunge into the Earth's core where ancient gods are rumored to reside. These caverns are interlinked by luminous groves, which serve as meeting points for beings from all domains. At the edge of the world, a perpetually dark forest expands and contracts over time, symbiotically connected to the roots of the mountains, maintaining the world's delicate balance.",
  
  "history": "The realm's history is a tapestry of empires rising and falling, influenced by the celestial beings believed to reside at the Earth's core. The underground caverns, now a labyrinth of secret passageways and glowing flora, were initially carved by dragons. These dragons are not extinct but have entered a centuries-long hibernation, their presence still felt through the warm air that rises from the depths.",
  
  "culture": "matriarchy with a council of elder women guiding clans,lunar worship featuring monthly pilgrimages to the highest mountain peaks, ancestral veneration where the spirits are believed to reside in sacred groves within the dark forest",
  
  "magic_system": "The magical system is intricately tied to the celestial alignment of moons and stars, but its complexity extends to the Astral Plane. Spellcasters not only draw power from celestial bodies but can also tap into the dormant energy of the sleeping dragons, or the life force that emanates from the interconnected roots of the forest and mountains."
